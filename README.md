## Nemo Action installation

These instructions assume a Debian/Ubuntu based distro for the commands to
install dependencies. For users of other distros please replace `sudo apt`
with the equivalent for your distro's package management system.

First install git

```bash
sudo apt install git

To have a functional Nemo actions pack you have to install first all the

Having cloned the repo you can either install all the actions using the

To install all the nemo actions use the **install.sh** bash file and for

### Install applications
```bash
chmod a+x install.sh install_apps.sh
```
For install_apps.sh script you have:
_(all|install|uninstall|reinstall|installBulky|uninstallBulky|listPackages)_

* **listPackages** command will show a list of what packages are going to be installed

To perform the installation for dependency applications use:

```bash
sudo ./install_apps.sh all
```

_(install|uninstall|reinstall|)_

## Nemo Action updating

In a terminal navigate to the `sgs.nemo-actions` folder created when you
originally cloned the repo

e.g `cd sgs.nemo-actions`

Once in the correct folder update your local copy with the latest commits,
before reinstalling your actions.

`git pull origin; cd ..`

## Debug

`nemo -q; NEMO_DEBUG=Actions NEMO_ACTION_VERBOSE=5 nemo --debug`

## Write an action

To make scripts executed to multiple files with a progress bar,
use `bash_action.sh`. Simple example:
  - execute `ls` command on each selected files:
    `Exec=<scripts/bash_action.py "ls {}" %F>`
  - same effect, but adding a bash variable:
    `Exec=<scripts/bash_action.py "filename={}; ls \"$filename\"" %F>`

Take a look to existing actions. Particularly `flac_to_wav.nemo_action` is a simple real-world example.

To specify icon you can use `Icon-Name`. Available icons are located in `/usr/share/icons/gnome/32x32/actions`.

## Debug actions (show actions logs and Nemo errors about actions)

```
nemo -q; NEMO_ACTION_VERBOSE=1 nemo --no-desktop
```

### Some tricks:
- the space between `"` and `%F>` is important; ie `"%F>` will **not** work
